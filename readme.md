# instruction of usage

# what you can do through this project
+ ## can operate spike rate encoding
+ ## can use back porpagate calculation thorough spiking neural network
+ ## can classify iris classification by SNN

# 1. image of spike encoding

## Encoding
+ ### since Iris data is real based value, the process convert to time-series data is required.
